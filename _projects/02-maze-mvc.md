## Overview

Maze MVC is a Java-based game framework implementing the Model-View-Controller design pattern for creating interactive maze games with real-time rendering.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Clean separation between game logic (Model), rendering (View), and user input (Controller)
- **Graphics Rendering**: Real-time 2D graphics using Java Swing
- **Game Logic**: Maze generation and pathfinding algorithms
- **User Input**: Keyboard and mouse controls
- **State Management**: Proper game state handling

## Architecture

### Model
- Game board and maze data structures
- Player position and game state
- Collision detection
- Win/lose conditions

### View
- Graphics rendering using Swing
- Real-time frame updates
- UI components and HUD

### Controller
- Input handling (keyboard, mouse)
- Game updates based on user actions
- Event dispatching

## Technologies

- **Language**: Java
- **GUI**: Swing
- **Design Pattern**: MVC
- **Graphics**: 2D rendering

## Learning Outcomes

- Deep understanding of MVC architecture
- Graphics programming in Java
- Game loop implementation
- Input handling and event-driven programming
